# FLS_Motion_Illumination

Though the original motion illumination algorithm, Motill, is able to generate
minimal FLS flight distance, its runtime complexity is too high. Therefore, the
objective of my project is to discover improved runtime complexity and more
suitable approaches for motion illumination. In this report, I will talk about 3
major works that Iâ€™ve done, including keyframing, designing a novel algorithm
for performing rotation by changing FLS color and investigating the potential
of ICP algorithm on motion illumination.

To run ICP.py, installation of numpy in Blender is required. I found a useful video talking about how to install python module in Blender: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyRoY9QUNg0&t=167s
